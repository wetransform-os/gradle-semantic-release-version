gradle-semantic-release-version
===============================

Gradle plugin that manages the project version based on:

- A version file containing the last release version
- Information from the git repository the project resides in

The plugin works based on the following assumptions:

1. When a release is created
    - The release version is written to the version file
        - The task `setReleaseVersion` can be used for that
    - A commit is created the includes the change to the version file and other release related changes
    - A tag is created that marks the commit as the release
2. If the git repository is clean and HEAD points to a tag, the project version is the release version
3. If the git repository is not clean or HEAD does not point to a tag, the project version is a SNAPSHOT version that increases the minor version compared to the last release version
4. If no release version is configured or the version file is missing, the project version is `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`

By default the version file is assumed to be the file `version.txt` in the root project.
