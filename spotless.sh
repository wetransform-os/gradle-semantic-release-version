# Script that runs spotlessApply for a single file.
# In case no file path is provided, the formatting is applied to the whole project.
#
# Advantage over calling Gradle for a single file directly is identifying a subproject and only running the task there.
# Also, Gradle is only run for certain file extensions (in case this can't be filtered easily when calling the script)
#
# We can't avoid the Gradle configuration phase which takes relatively long due to the number of subprojects,
# But when targeting individual projects we can speed up the process using the on-demand configuration feature
# (see https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_configuration_and_execution.html).
#
# Configuration as file watcher in IntelliJ:
#
# 1. Install File Watchers plugin
# 2. Settings -> Tools -> File Watchers -> Add
#
# File type:               Any
# Program:                 $ProjectFileDir$/spotless.sh
# Arguments:               $FilePath$
# Output paths to refresh: $FilePath$
# Working directory:       $ProjectFileDir$
#
# Disable
# - auto save on editing running the tool while editing
# - external changes sync to avoid running the tool when files are externally modified
